### Design a door handle sanitizing attachment
## Introduction
Diseases can spread in many ways. An infected person can cough or sneeze and transmit germs through droplets in the air. Besides that, germs can also be transferred through direct contact such as a handshake, or indirectly by touching an object that was previously touched by an infected person. Research has shown that door handles, especially public ones, are one of the most unhygienic objects due to their frequent usage. They are hotspots for bacteria and viruses which are left behind by a person and transmitted to another person who touches the door handle afterwards. The transfer of these viruses are threats that can snowball into a health crisis, as seen in the recent case of the highly contagious COVID-19 virus outbreak.

Resolving this threat and turning it into an opportunity, our group intends to create a device that sanitises our hands upon opening doors. The concept is simple. Every time the door handle is turned, the force pressing down on the handle will trigger our product to function. A nozzle will spray liquid sanitiser onto the userâ€™s hands to kill potential bacteria or viruses that come from contact with the door handle. Not forgetting the bacteria on the handle, the excess liquid sanitiser from the trigger will also disinfect the handle and the surroundings.

The main advantage of using our product is that its working principle does not require any electricity, but functions purely mechanically. In addition, it is cheap in cost and requires minimal maintenance, hence making it an accessible product to most consumers. Furthermore, liquid sanitiser can be purchased from external sources and refilled through the cap on the storage tank, which does not require much work.

Despite having self-sanitising door handles in the market, most of them are either very expensive to set up or require high maintenance even if they are cheap. For example, there is a self- sanitising glowing door handle that uses titanium dioxide as a bacteria-killing mineral. In this system, the door needs to be modified in order to fit in a gearbox that charges the LED in the glass cylinder for the mineral to start working. Although it costs around 13 USD for the entire system, major modifications are needed. Other self-sanitising door handles using silver ions to kill germs also need to be replaced regularly, to replenish the ions at a high cost. On the other hand, our product is an attachment that can be easily fixed onto door handles without reworking original door handles (door levers). It includes a modified nozzle, frame and an external storage tank containing sanitiser which can be attached to the door surface for ease of use. It does notrequire much maintenance as only refills of the sanitiser storage tank are needed.
